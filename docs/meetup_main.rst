**MeetUp** is a two-player coordination and reference game.

The *basic idea* behind the MeetUp is easy to describe: two players move around
in a visually represented environment, with the objective to find each other.
They are not able to see each other, even if they are indeed in the same location.
The only way to meet their objective is by describing to each other what they see,
and determining on that basis whether they are in the same location in the environment.

For details about production environment, please refer to :ref:`meetup_depl`.

WILL BE WRITTEN SOON:

Detailed instructions on how to play the MeetUp are available in our Git repository.
